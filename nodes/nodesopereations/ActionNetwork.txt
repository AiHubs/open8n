TextBlock(text="Authentication Methods:\nThe ActionNetwork node uses a credential called 'actionNetworkApi' which is required for authentication. The authentication method is not explicitly mentioned in the code, but it is likely using an API key or token for authentication with the Action Network API.\n\nInput Parameters:\n1. Resource (required): The resource to operate on. Options include 'Attendance', 'Event', 'Person', 'Person Tag', 'Petition', 'Signature', and 'Tag'.\n2. Operation (required): The operation to perform on the selected resource.\n3. Additional parameters are required based on the selected resource and operation, such as IDs, field values, and other data.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure varies based on the selected operation. For operations that return data, such as 'get' and 'getAll', the output is an array of data objects representing the requested resource(s). For operations that create or update data, the output is typically the created or updated data object.\n\nSupported Operations:\nThe supported operations depend on the selected resource. They include:\n\n- Attendance: create, get, getAll\n- Event: create, get, getAll\n- Person: create, get, getAll, update\n- Petition: create, get, getAll, update\n- Signature: create, get, getAll, update\n- Tag: create, get, getAll\n- Person Tag: add, remove\n\nRequired Parameters:\nThe required parameters vary based on the selected resource and operation. Generally, IDs (e.g., personId, eventId, petitionId) are required for operations that interact with specific resources, and field values (e.g., title, email_addresses) are required for create and update operations.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node uses try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors that occur during execution. If the 'continueOnFail' parameter is set, the error is added to the output data as an error object, and execution continues. Otherwise, the error is thrown, and execution stops.\n\nThe node also includes a check for required fields during certain operations. If required fields are missing, a NodeOperationError is thrown with an appropriate error message.\n\nOverall Analysis:\nThe ActionNetwork node is a comprehensive node that provides a wide range of operations for interacting with the Action Network API. It supports various resources, including attendances, events, people, petitions, signatures, tags, and person tags. The node follows a consistent structure and allows for flexible input and output handling. It incorporates error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user. The code is well-organized and modular, with separate functions and descriptions for different operations and resources. Overall, the ActionNetwork node offers a robust and user-friendly way to integrate with the Action Network API within the system.", type='text')
