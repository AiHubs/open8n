TextBlock(text='# Action Network Node Analysis\n\n## 1. Node Purpose and Main Functionality\n\nThe Action Network node is designed to interact with the Action Network API, which is a platform for organizing and managing political campaigns, petitions, and events. The node provides a wide range of operations to create, retrieve, update, and manage various resources within the Action Network ecosystem, such as attendances, events, people, petitions, signatures, tags, and person tags.\n\n## 2. Input Parameters\n\nThe node accepts the following input parameters:\n\n- **Resource**: The type of resource to interact with (e.g., attendance, event, person, petition, signature, tag, personTag).\n- **Operation**: The operation to perform on the selected resource (e.g., create, get, getAll, update, add, remove).\n- **Additional Fields**: Depending on the selected resource and operation, the node may require additional input fields. These fields are dynamically displayed based on the selected options.\n\n## 3. Output Structure\n\nThe output structure of the node varies depending on the selected operation and whether the "simple" parameter is enabled or not. If the "simple" parameter is enabled, the output will be a simplified version of the API response. Otherwise, the output will be the full API response.\n\n## 4. Supported Operations\n\nThe node supports the following operations for each resource:\n\n### Attendance\n- **Create**: Create a new attendance record for an event.\n- **Get**: Retrieve a specific attendance record.\n- **GetAll**: Retrieve all attendance records for an event.\n\n### Event\n- **Create**: Create a new event.\n- **Get**: Retrieve a specific event.\n- **GetAll**: Retrieve all events.\n\n### Person\n- **Create**: Create a new person record.\n- **Get**: Retrieve a specific person record.\n- **GetAll**: Retrieve all person records.\n- **Update**: Update an existing person record.\n\n### Petition\n- **Create**: Create a new petition.\n- **Get**: Retrieve a specific petition.\n- **GetAll**: Retrieve all petitions.\n- **Update**: Update an existing petition.\n\n### Signature\n- **Create**: Create a new signature for a petition.\n- **Get**: Retrieve a specific signature.\n- **GetAll**: Retrieve all signatures for a petition.\n- **Update**: Update an existing signature.\n\n### Tag\n- **Create**: Create a new tag.\n- **Get**: Retrieve a specific tag.\n- **GetAll**: Retrieve all tags.\n\n### PersonTag\n- **Add**: Add a tag to a person.\n- **Remove**: Remove a tag from a person.\n\n## 5. Notable Features or Limitations\n\n- The node supports authentication using the Action Network API credentials.\n- The node handles pagination for `getAll` operations automatically.\n- The node adjusts the payload structure based on the selected resource and operation to match the API requirements.\n- The node does not support certain advanced features of the Action Network API, such as querying or filtering results.\n\n## 6. Integration Points with Other Systems\n\nThe Action Network node does not have direct integration points with other systems. However, it can be used in conjunction with other nodes in n8n workflows to automate processes and integrate with other systems or APIs.\n\n## 7. Error Handling Mechanisms\n\nThe node implements the following error handling mechanisms:\n\n- If an error occurs during the execution of an operation, the node will throw a `NodeOperationError` with a descriptive error message.\n- If the `continueOnFail` parameter is enabled, the node will skip the current item and continue with the next one, adding the error message to the output data.\n\n## 8. Other Relevant Information\n\n- The node uses the `actionNetworkApiRequest` function to make API requests, which handles authentication and error handling.\n- The node utilizes helper functions like `adjustEventPayload`, `adjustPersonPayload`, `adjustPetitionPayload`, `handleListing`, and `makeOsdiLink` to prepare the request payloads and handle pagination.\n- The node includes detailed descriptions and UI fields for each resource and operation, which are defined in separate files (`descriptions.ts` and `types.ts`).\n\nOverall, the Action Network node provides a comprehensive set of operations to interact with the Action Network API, enabling users to automate various tasks related to campaign management, event organization, and petition handling within n8n workflows.', type='text')
