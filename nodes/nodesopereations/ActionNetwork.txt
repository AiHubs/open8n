TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nActionNetwork is a node that allows users to interact with the Action Network API. It provides functionalities related to managing events, attendances, petitions, signatures, people, tags, and taggings within the Action Network platform.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node requires the following input parameters:\n- Resource: The resource to operate on (e.g., Attendance, Event, Person, Petition, Signature, Tag, Person Tag).\n- Operation: The specific operation to perform on the selected resource.\n- Additional parameters: Depending on the selected resource and operation, additional parameters may be required (e.g., IDs, names, email addresses, etc.).\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure varies based on the selected operation and resource. It typically returns the created, retrieved, or updated data as an array of objects or a single object. The output can be simplified using the "simple" parameter, which returns a simplified version of the response.\n\nSupported Operations and Required Parameters:\n\n1. Attendance:\n   - Create: Requires personId and eventId.\n   - Get: Requires eventId and attendanceId.\n   - GetAll: Requires eventId.\n\n2. Event:\n   - Create: Requires originSystem and title. Additional fields can be provided.\n   - Get: Requires eventId.\n   - GetAll: No additional parameters required.\n\n3. Person:\n   - Create: Requires email_addresses.\n   - Get: Requires personId.\n   - GetAll: No additional parameters required.\n   - Update: Requires personId and updateFields.\n\n4. Petition:\n   - Create: Requires originSystem and title. Additional fields can be provided.\n   - Get: Requires petitionId.\n   - GetAll: No additional parameters required.\n   - Update: Requires petitionId and updateFields.\n\n5. Signature:\n   - Create: Requires personId, petitionId, and additional fields (optional).\n   - Get: Requires petitionId and signatureId.\n   - GetAll: Requires petitionId.\n   - Update: Requires petitionId, signatureId, and updateFields.\n\n6. Tag:\n   - Create: Requires name.\n   - Get: Requires tagId.\n   - GetAll: No additional parameters required.\n\n7. Person Tag:\n   - Add: Requires personId and tagId.\n   - Remove: Requires tagId and taggingId.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe node requires an Action Network API credential, which needs to be configured in the system\'s credential management system.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node implements error handling mechanisms to catch and handle errors that may occur during execution. If the "Continue on Fail" option is enabled, the node will continue processing the remaining items in case of an error and include the error message in the output data. Otherwise, the node will throw an error and stop execution.\n\nImportant Details:\n- The node utilizes various helper functions (e.g., actionNetworkApiRequest, adjustEventPayload, adjustPersonPayload, adjustPetitionPayload, handleListing, makeOsdiLink, resourceLoaders, simplifyResponse) to facilitate API requests, data manipulation, and response handling.\n- The node supports dynamic loading of options for certain parameters using the loadOptions method.\n- The node provides comprehensive descriptions and field definitions for each resource and operation through the descriptions module.\n- The node uses types and interfaces defined in the types module for better code organization and maintainability.', type='text')
