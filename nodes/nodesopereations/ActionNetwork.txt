TextBlock(text='I will provide a comprehensive analysis of the ActionNetwork node, covering the requested aspects in a structured format with headings.\n\nNode Purpose and Main Functionality:\nThe ActionNetwork node is designed to interact with the Action Network API, enabling users to perform various operations related to activism and campaigning. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the creation, retrieval, updating, and management of resources such as events, petitions, signatures, and person data within the Action Network platform.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node accepts the following input parameters:\n- Resource: Specifies the type of resource to interact with (e.g., Attendance, Event, Person, Petition, Signature, Tag, or PersonTag).\n- Operation: Determines the action to perform on the selected resource (e.g., create, get, getAll, update, add, or remove).\n- Additional Fields: Depending on the selected resource and operation, the node may require additional input fields specific to that combination.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure of the node varies based on the selected operation and resource. In general, the output is an array of data objects representing the retrieved or created resources. The `simple` parameter can be used to simplify the output by returning only essential fields.\n\nSupported Operations:\nThe node supports the following operations for each resource:\n\n1. Attendance:\n   - Create: Create a new attendance record for an event.\n   - Get: Retrieve a specific attendance record.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all attendance records for an event.\n\n2. Event:\n   - Create: Create a new event.\n   - Get: Retrieve a specific event.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all events.\n\n3. Person:\n   - Create: Create a new person record.\n   - Get: Retrieve a specific person record.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all person records.\n   - Update: Update an existing person record.\n\n4. Petition:\n   - Create: Create a new petition.\n   - Get: Retrieve a specific petition.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all petitions.\n   - Update: Update an existing petition.\n\n5. Signature:\n   - Create: Create a new signature for a petition.\n   - Get: Retrieve a specific signature.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all signatures for a petition.\n   - Update: Update an existing signature.\n\n6. Tag:\n   - Create: Create a new tag.\n   - Get: Retrieve a specific tag.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all tags.\n\n7. PersonTag:\n   - Add: Add a tag to a person.\n   - Remove: Remove a tag from a person.\n\nNotable Features or Limitations:\n- The node provides comprehensive support for various resources and operations within the Action Network API.\n- It includes helper functions for adjusting payloads, handling listings, and simplifying responses.\n- The node utilizes the system\'s credential system to securely authenticate with the Action Network API.\n- Error handling is implemented to handle failures gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nIntegration Points with Other Systems:\nThe ActionNetwork node does not directly integrate with other systems. However, it can be combined with other nodes in the system\'s workflow to enable complex automation scenarios involving data from multiple sources.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node implements error handling using the system\'s built-in mechanisms. Errors are caught and handled gracefully, with the option to continue processing subsequent items (`continueOnFail`) or halt the execution. Error messages are propagated to the user for troubleshooting purposes.\n\nOther Relevant Information:\n- The node includes detailed descriptions and default values for its properties, making it easier to configure and use.\n- It supports loading options for certain fields, allowing users to dynamically populate dropdown values from the Action Network API.\n- The node follows the system\'s coding conventions and best practices for maintainability and extensibility.\n\nTo interact with the ActionNetwork node, perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Configure the node by selecting the desired resource and operation.\n2. Provide the required input parameters for the selected resource and operation.\n3. If necessary, enter additional fields specific to the chosen combination of resource and operation.\n4. Specify whether to simplify the output by enabling the "simple" parameter.\n5. Execute the node within the workflow to perform the desired action on the Action Network API.\n6. Handle any errors that may occur during execution and ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place.\n7. Utilize the output data from the node in subsequent steps of the workflow or integrate it with other nodes as needed.\n\nRemember to securely store and manage the Action Network API credentials using the system\'s credential management system.', type='text')
