TextBlock(text='Sure, here\'s a detailed analysis of the ActionNetwork Node:\n\nNode Purpose and Main Functionality:\nThe ActionNetwork Node is designed to interact with the Action Network API, which is a platform for organizing and managing advocacy campaigns. This node allows users to perform various operations related to events, petitions, people, signatures, tags, and attendance records.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node requires several input parameters, which vary depending on the selected operation and resource. These parameters include:\n\n- Resource: The type of resource to work with (e.g., event, petition, person, signature, tag, attendance, personTag).\n- Operation: The specific action to perform on the selected resource (e.g., create, get, getAll, update, add, remove).\n- Additional parameters: Depending on the selected resource and operation, additional input parameters may be required, such as event details, petition information, person data, tag names, and identifiers for specific entities.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure of the node depends on the selected operation and whether the "simple" option is enabled. The output can be a single object or an array of objects, containing the requested data from the Action Network API.\n\nSupported Operations:\nThe node supports the following operations for each resource:\n\n- Attendance: create, get, getAll\n- Event: create, get, getAll\n- Person: create, get, getAll, update\n- Petition: create, get, getAll, update\n- Signature: create, get, getAll, update\n- Tag: create, get, getAll\n- PersonTag: add, remove\n\nNotable Features or Limitations:\n- The node utilizes the Action Network API, so its functionality is limited by the capabilities provided by the API.\n- The node handles pagination for "getAll" operations to retrieve all available data.\n- The node adjusts the payload format for some operations to match the API requirements.\n- The node provides options to simplify the output data structure.\n\nIntegration Points with Other Systems:\nThe ActionNetwork Node does not directly integrate with other systems. However, it can be used in conjunction with other nodes in the system to create workflows and automate processes involving Action Network data.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node handles errors thrown by the Action Network API and provides appropriate error messages. It also includes checks for missing required parameters and throws errors accordingly. The node supports the "continueOnFail" option, allowing the workflow to continue executing if an error occurs for a particular item.\n\nOther Relevant Information:\n- The node imports various helper functions from other files to handle API requests, payload adjustments, and data simplification.\n- The node uses the system\'s built-in functions for executing HTTP requests, retrieving input data, and returning output data.\n- The node exports its functionality as an INodeType interface, which is required by the system.', type='text')
