TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nThe ActionNetwork node is designed to interact with the Action Network API, allowing users to perform various operations related to events, petitions, people, tags, and more. It provides a convenient way to consume the Action Network API within the system\'s workflow.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node requires the following input parameters:\n\n- Resource (required): Specifies the type of resource to be accessed, such as Attendance, Event, Person, Petition, Signature, Tag, or Person Tag.\n- Operation (required): Determines the specific operation to be performed on the selected resource, such as create, get, getAll, update, add, or remove.\n- Additional fields (depending on the selected operation and resource): These fields capture the necessary data for the requested operation, such as event details, person information, petition details, etc.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure of the node varies depending on the selected operation and resource. Generally, it returns the data associated with the executed operation, such as created or retrieved records, updated information, or success/failure messages.\n\nSupported Operations:\nThe ActionNetwork node supports the following operations for each resource:\n\n1. Attendance:\n   - Create: Create a new attendance record for a person at an event.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific attendance record.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve a list of all attendance records for a given event.\n\n2. Event:\n   - Create: Create a new event with specified details.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific event.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve a list of all events.\n\n3. Person:\n   - Create: Create a new person record with provided information.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific person.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve a list of all people.\n   - Update: Update the information of a specific person.\n\n4. Petition:\n   - Create: Create a new petition with specified details.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific petition.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve a list of all petitions.\n   - Update: Update the information of a specific petition.\n\n5. Signature:\n   - Create: Create a new signature for a person on a specific petition.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific signature.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve a list of all signatures for a given petition.\n   - Update: Update the information of a specific signature.\n\n6. Tag:\n   - Create: Create a new tag.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific tag.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve a list of all tags.\n\n7. Person Tag:\n   - Add: Add a tag to a specific person.\n   - Remove: Remove a tag from a specific person.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe ActionNetwork node requires authentication using the "actionNetworkApi" credential, which must be provided in the system\'s credentials manager.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node implements error handling mechanisms to handle various types of errors that may occur during the execution of operations. If an error occurs, the node will either throw an exception or, if the "Continue on Fail" option is enabled, it will return the error message as part of the output data.\n\nOther Important Details:\n- The node utilizes helper functions and descriptions from separate files to handle API requests, data adjustments, and field/operation definitions.\n- The node supports simplifying the output data for better readability by removing unnecessary fields.\n- The node follows the OSDI (Open Source Data Integration) standard for certain operations, such as linking a person to an event or petition.\n\nUsage and Implementation:\nTo use the ActionNetwork node in the system\'s workflow, simply add the node to the desired location in the workflow editor and configure the required parameters based on the desired operation and resource. The node can be combined with other nodes to create complex workflows and automate various tasks related to Action Network.', type='text')
