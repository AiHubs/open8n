TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nThe node is named "Adalo" and is designed to consume the Adalo API. Adalo is a platform that allows users to create and manage custom apps without coding. The node\'s description states that it belongs to the "transform" group within the system.\n\nInput Parameters:\n1. Resource (required): Currently, only the "Collection" option is available.\n2. Operation (required): The available operations are Create, Delete, Get, Get Many, and Update.\n3. Collection ID (required): The ID of the Adalo collection to perform operations on.\n4. Additional input fields based on the selected operation, such as Row ID, Data to Send, Fields UI, and Limit.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure varies depending on the selected operation. For example, the "Get" operation returns the retrieved row, while the "Delete" operation returns a simple success object.\n\nSupported Operations:\n1. Create: Creates a new row in the specified collection.\n2. Delete: Deletes a row from the specified collection using the Row ID.\n3. Get: Retrieves a single row from the specified collection using the Row ID.\n4. Get Many: Retrieves multiple rows from the specified collection.\n5. Update: Updates an existing row in the specified collection using the Row ID.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe node requires an "adaloApi" credential, which is marked as required. This credential likely contains the necessary authentication information to access the Adalo API.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node does not appear to have explicit error handling mechanisms defined within the provided code. However, the system may have built-in mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions.\n\nImportant Details and Usage:\n- The node uses the Adalo API to interact with Adalo collections and perform CRUD operations.\n- The "presendCreateUpdate" function is used to prepare the request body for Create and Update operations. It supports two modes: "autoMapInputData" and "defineBelow".\n- In "autoMapInputData" mode, the function maps input data from the system to the request body, excluding keys specified in the "inputsToIgnore" parameter.\n- In "defineBelow" mode, the function maps the "fieldsUi.fieldValues" parameter to the request body.\n- The node supports pagination for the "Get Many" operation, using the "offset" pagination type.\n- The node\'s subtitle dynamically displays the selected operation and collection ID.\n\nRequired Parameters:\nThe node requires the following parameters:\n1. Resource (Collection)\n2. Operation (Create, Delete, Get, Get Many, Update)\n3. Collection ID\n4. Credential (adaloApi)\n\nThe specific required parameters may vary based on the selected operation. For example, the "Get" and "Delete" operations require the Row ID parameter, while the "Create" and "Update" operations require additional data fields.', type='text')
