TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description\nThe node is named "AirtableTrigger" and belongs to the "Airtable" service. It is designed to trigger the workflow when specific events occur in an Airtable table. The node\'s description states: "Starts the workflow when Airtable events occur."\n\nInput Parameters\n1. Authentication: Specifies the authentication method to connect to Airtable. The options are API Key, Access Token, and OAuth2.\n2. Base: The Airtable Base in which to operate. Can be provided as a URL or an ID.\n3. Table: The Airtable Table within the specified Base. Can be provided as a URL or an ID.\n4. Trigger Field: A required field that specifies the Created Time or Last Modified Time field to be used for sorting records. This field is essential for the trigger to work correctly.\n5. Download Attachments: A boolean parameter that determines whether attachment fields specified in the "Download Fields" parameter will be downloaded.\n6. Download Fields: A comma-separated list of field names of type "attachment" that should be downloaded. Required when "Download Attachments" is set to true.\n7. Additional Fields: A collection of optional parameters, including:\n   - Fields: Additional fields to be included in the response, separated by commas.\n   - Formula: A formula to filter records based on conditions.\n   - View ID: The name or ID of a specific view in the table. If set, only records from that view will be returned.\n\nOutput Structure\nThe node returns an array of records from the specified Airtable table, with each record represented as an IDataObject. If "Download Attachments" is enabled, the output will include the downloaded attachments for the specified fields.\n\nSupported Operations and Required Parameters\nThe node supports the following operation:\n\n1. Poll: This operation retrieves records from the specified Airtable table based on the configured parameters.\n   - Required Parameters: Authentication, Base, Table, Trigger Field.\n\nAuthentication Methods\nThe node supports the following authentication methods:\n\n1. API Key: Authenticate using an Airtable API key.\n2. Access Token: Authenticate using an Airtable access token.\n3. OAuth2: Authenticate using the OAuth2 protocol with Airtable.\n\nError Handling\nThe node includes error handling mechanisms to catch and handle various types of errors that may occur during the execution of the node. For example, if the specified "Trigger Field" does not exist in the table, the node will throw a NodeOperationError with an appropriate error message.\n\nImportant Details\n1. The node is designed to be used as a trigger node, meaning it will start the workflow when specific events occur in the specified Airtable table.\n2. The "Trigger Field" parameter is crucial for the node to function correctly. It must be a field that represents the Created Time or Last Modified Time of records in the table.\n3. The "Download Attachments" and "Download Fields" parameters allow the node to download attachments from the specified fields during the execution.\n4. The "Additional Fields" parameters provide flexibility in filtering and retrieving specific fields or views from the Airtable table.\n5. The node uses the system\'s polling mechanism to periodically check for new or updated records in the specified table based on the "Trigger Field" and other configured parameters.\n\nThe analysis covers the node\'s name and description, input parameters, output structure, supported operations and required parameters, authentication methods, error handling mechanisms, and other important details about the node\'s functionality and usage within the system.', type='text')
