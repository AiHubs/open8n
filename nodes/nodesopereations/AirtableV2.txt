TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nThe analyzed code defines a Node named "AirtableV2" for the system. It does not provide an explicit description of the node\'s functionality.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe code does not reveal any specific input parameters for this node. However, it is likely that the node accepts input parameters related to Airtable API operations, such as resource type, operation type, and associated data.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe code does not provide information about the output structure of this node.\n\nSupported Operations and Required Parameters:\nThe code does not explicitly list the supported operations or required parameters. However, it imports several methods that may provide clues about the supported operations:\n\n1. `listSearch`: This method likely handles listing and searching operations for Airtable resources.\n2. `loadOptions`: This method probably loads configuration options or metadata related to Airtable resources.\n3. `resourceMapping`: This method likely maps system resources to corresponding Airtable resources.\n\nAdditionally, the `router` module seems to handle the execution of different operations based on the provided input.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe code does not provide any information about authentication methods for the AirtableV2 node.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe code does not reveal any specific error handling mechanisms for this node.\n\nOther Important Details:\n1. The node implements the `INodeType` interface, suggesting that it adheres to the system\'s node architecture and conventions.\n2. The `description` property is constructed by combining a `baseDescription` (likely provided by the system) and a `versionDescription` (imported from `./actions/versionDescription`).\n3. The `execute` method is an async function that calls the `router.call` method, possibly to route the execution to different handlers based on the provided input.\n\nUsage:\nThe code does not provide any usage examples or guidelines for this node. However, based on the node\'s name and the imported methods, it is likely used to interact with the Airtable API, performing operations such as listing, searching, and managing resources.\n\nStructured Analysis:\n\nNode Name and Description:\n- Node Name: AirtableV2\n- Description: Not provided in the code\n\nInput Parameters:\n- Not specified in the code\n\nOutput Structure:\n- Not specified in the code\n\nSupported Operations and Required Parameters:\n- `listSearch`: Likely for listing and searching Airtable resources\n- `loadOptions`: Likely for loading configuration options or metadata\n- `resourceMapping`: Likely for mapping system resources to Airtable resources\n- Other operations handled by the `router` module\n\nAuthentication Methods:\n- Not specified in the code\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\n- Not specified in the code\n\nOther Important Details:\n- Implements the `INodeType` interface\n- Description constructed from `baseDescription` and `versionDescription`\n- `execute` method calls `router.call` for operation routing\n\nUsage:\n- Not provided in the code\n- Likely used for interacting with the Airtable API and managing resources', type='text')
