TextBlock(text="Node Name and Description:\nThe Airtable node is designed to interact with the Airtable API, allowing users to read, update, write, and delete data from Airtable within the system workflow.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node does not explicitly define any input parameters. However, it likely requires authentication credentials or API keys to access the Airtable API.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure is not specified in the provided code snippet. It will depend on the specific operation being performed and the data returned from the Airtable API.\n\nSupported Operations and Required Parameters:\nThe code snippet does not provide details about the supported operations or required parameters. However, based on the description, it is expected to support the following operations:\n\n1. Read data from Airtable\n2. Update data in Airtable\n3. Write (create) data in Airtable\n4. Delete data from Airtable\n\nThe required parameters for each operation will depend on the Airtable API specifications and the specific data being accessed or manipulated.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe code snippet does not provide information about the authentication methods used by the Airtable node. However, common authentication methods for APIs include:\n\n1. API Key\n2. OAuth 2.0\n3. Basic Authentication\n\nThe authentication method used will depend on the requirements of the Airtable API.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe code snippet does not provide any information about error handling mechanisms implemented in the Airtable node.\n\nOther Important Details:\n1. The Airtable node is a VersionedNodeType, which means it supports multiple versions of the node implementation. The current default version is 2.1.\n2. The node is categorized in the 'input' group, suggesting that it is primarily used for retrieving data from Airtable.\n3. The node icon is specified as 'file:airtable.svg', which likely refers to an SVG file containing the node's icon.\n\nUsage:\nTo use the Airtable node within the system workflow, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Add the Airtable node to your workflow.\n2. Configure the node with the required authentication credentials or API keys.\n3. Select the desired operation (read, update, write, or delete) and provide the necessary parameters.\n4. Connect the Airtable node to other nodes in the workflow to process the data retrieved or manipulated by the node.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual usage and implementation details may vary based on the specific version of the Airtable node being used and the requirements of your workflow.", type='text')
