TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nThe node is named "AirtableV1" and its description states that it is used to "Read, update, write and delete data from Airtable". Airtable is a cloud-based spreadsheet-database hybrid service that allows users to create and manage databases with customizable fields and views.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node accepts the following input parameters:\n- Authentication: The authentication method to be used (Access Token, OAuth2, or API Key).\n- Base: The Airtable Base (database) to operate on, specified either by URL or ID.\n- Table: The specific table within the Base to operate on, specified either by URL or ID.\n- Operation: The action to perform on the specified table (Append, Delete, List, Read, or Update).\n\nAdditional parameters are required depending on the chosen operation, such as field names, record IDs, filtering options, and more.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure varies based on the selected operation:\n- Append, Delete, Read, and Update operations return an array of records with the specified fields and any associated metadata.\n- The List operation returns an array of all records matching the specified filters and options.\n\nSupported Operations and Required Parameters:\n1. Append: Adds new records to the specified table. Required parameters are fields to include (or an option to include all fields) and any additional options like bulk size and type casting.\n2. Delete: Removes records from the specified table. Required parameter is the record ID(s) to delete, with options like bulk size.\n3. List: Retrieves records from the specified table based on provided filters and options. Required parameters include whether to return all records or a limited number, and options like fields to include, filtering formulas, sorting rules, and views.\n4. Read: Retrieves a specific record from the specified table. Required parameter is the record ID.\n5. Update: Modifies an existing record in the specified table. Required parameters are the record ID, fields to update (or an option to update all fields), and any additional options like bulk size, ignored fields, and type casting.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe node supports the following authentication methods:\n1. Access Token: Requires an Airtable Access Token credential.\n2. OAuth2: Requires an Airtable OAuth2 credential.\n3. API Key (Deprecated): This method is deprecated and should not be used anymore.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node implements error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures. If the "Continue on Fail" option is enabled, the system will continue executing the workflow, and the error message will be included in the output data. Otherwise, the system will throw an error and stop the execution.\n\nOther Important Details:\n- The node uses the Airtable API to interact with Airtable bases and tables.\n- It supports advanced features like downloading attachments, sorting records, and filtering records using formulas.\n- The node is designed to handle rate limiting and make requests in a way that avoids hitting Airtable\'s rate limits.\n- It provides options for bulk operations to improve performance when working with large datasets.\n- The node is part of the system\'s core functionality and is maintained by the system developers.', type='text')
