TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nThe node is named "Affinity" and is designed to interact with the Affinity API. It allows users to execute various operations related to lists, list entries, organizations, and persons within the Affinity platform.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node accepts the following input parameters:\n\n1. Resource (required): Specifies the resource type to interact with. Options include List, List Entry, Organization, and Person.\n2. Operation (required): Specifies the operation to perform on the selected resource. Available operations vary depending on the resource type.\n\nFor operations that require additional input, the following parameters may be required:\n\n1. List ID, List Entry ID, Person ID, Organization ID\n2. First Name, Last Name, Emails, Additional Fields (for creating/updating persons or organizations)\n3. Options (e.g., withInteractionDates, term for searching)\n4. Limit (for limiting the number of results when retrieving multiple items)\n5. ReturnAll (to retrieve all available items without pagination)\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure of the node depends on the selected operation and resource type. Generally, it returns the data associated with the requested resource, such as list details, list entry information, person details, or organization information.\n\nSupported Operations:\nThe node supports the following operations for each resource type:\n\n1. List:\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific list.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all available lists, with optional pagination and filtering.\n\n2. List Entry:\n   - Create: Create a new list entry.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific list entry.\n   - GetAll: Retrieve all list entries for a given list, with optional pagination.\n   - Delete: Delete a specific list entry.\n\n3. Person:\n   - Create: Create a new person.\n   - Update: Update an existing person\'s details.\n   - Get: Retrieve details of a specific person.\n   - GetAll: Search and retrieve persons, with optional filtering and pagination.\n   - Delete: Delete a specific person.\n\n4.

If an error occurs, the system will either throw an error or continue to the next item, depending on the user\'s configuration (continueOnFail parameter). If continueOnFail is enabled, the system will construct execution metadata with the error message and continue processing the remaining items.\n\nImportant Details:\n1. The node utilizes the affinityApiRequest and affinityApiRequestAllItems helper functions to interact with the Affinity API.\n2. For certain operations (e.g., getAll), the node supports pagination and retrieval of all available items.\n3. The node provides loading options to display available organizations, persons, and lists for easier selection during configuration.\n4. The node supports additional fields and options for customizing resource creation, updating, and filtering.\n\nRequired Parameters:\nThe only required parameter for the node is the "Resource" parameter, which specifies the type of resource to interact with (List, List Entry, Organization, or Person). The "Operation" parameter is also required, and its available options depend on the selected resource type.', type='text')
