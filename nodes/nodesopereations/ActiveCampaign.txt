If an error occurs, the system will either throw an exception with an error message or continue execution if the "continueOnFail" option is enabled. In the latter case, the error message will be included in the output data.\n\nImportant Details:\n1. The node supports loading options for custom fields, tags, and other dynamic data from the ActiveCampaign platform to simplify user input.\n2. The node includes utility functions for making API requests, handling pagination, and constructing response data.\n3. The node follows the system\'s conventions for handling input parameters, output data, and error handling.\n4. The node supports various resource types and operations, making it a versatile tool for interacting with the ActiveCampaign platform.\n\nOverall, the ActiveCampaign node provides a comprehensive set of features and functionality for integrating with the ActiveCampaign marketing automation platform within the system\'s workflow automation capabilities.', type='text')
