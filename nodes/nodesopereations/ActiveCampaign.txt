TextBlock(text='Node Name and Description:\nThe ActiveCampaign node is designed to create and edit data within the ActiveCampaign platform. It provides a wide range of operations to manage various resources such as contacts, deals, e-commerce orders, and more.\n\nInput Parameters:\nThe node supports numerous input parameters, which vary depending on the selected operation and resource. Some common parameters include:\n\n- Resource: The type of resource to interact with (e.g., contact, deal, e-commerce order).\n- Operation: The action to perform on the selected resource (e.g., create, update, delete, get).\n- Required Parameters: Depending on the operation, certain parameters are required, such as contact email for creating a contact or deal title for creating a deal.\n- Additional Fields: Many operations allow users to specify additional fields specific to the resource being handled.\n\nOutput Structure:\nThe output structure varies based on the operation performed. Generally, it returns an array of data objects, with each object representing the result of the operation for a specific item. The data contained within these objects depends on the resource and operation performed.\n\nSupported Operations:\nThe ActiveCampaign node supports a wide range of operations across various resources, including:\n\n1. Contact:\n   - Create, update, delete, get, and get all contacts.\n   - Add and remove contacts from contact lists and tags.\n\n2. Deal:\n   - Create, update, delete, get, and get all deals.\n   - Create and update deal notes.\n\n3. E-Commerce Order:\n   - Create, update, delete, get, and get all e-commerce orders.\n\n4. E-Commerce Customer:\n   - Create, update, delete, get, and get all e-commerce customers.\n\n5. E-Commerce Order Products:\n   - Get order products by product ID, order ID, or get all order products.\n\n6. Account:\n   - Create, update, delete, get, and get all accounts.\n\n7. Account Contact:\n   - Create, update, and delete account contacts.\n\n8. Connection:\n   - Create, update, delete, get, and get all connections.\n\n9. Contact List:\n   - Add and remove contacts from contact lists.\n\n10. List:\n    - Get all lists.\n\n11. Tag:\n    - Create, update, delete, get, and get all tags.\n\nAuthentication Methods:\nThe ActiveCampaign node requires an ActiveCampaign API credential to authenticate and interact with the ActiveCampaign platform.\n\nError Handling Mechanisms:\nThe node implements error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle and report any errors that occur during execution. If the "Continue on Fail" option is enabled, the system will continue processing the remaining items in the input data, while capturing and reporting the errors that occurred. If "Continue on Fail" is disabled, the execution will stop at the first encountered error.\n\nOther Important Details:\n- The node supports pagination for retrieving large datasets by implementing the "Return All" feature, which fetches all available data across multiple API requests.\n- The node provides load options for certain parameters, allowing users to dynamically load and select options from the ActiveCampaign platform (e.g., custom fields, tags).\n- The node handles custom properties and field values by automatically adding them to the request body based on the provided input parameters.\n\nRequired Parameters:\nThe required parameters vary depending on the selected operation and resource. For example, when creating a contact, the "email" parameter is required. When creating a deal, the "title," "contact," "value," and "currency" parameters are required. It\'s important to refer to the node documentation or the user interface for the specific required parameters for each operation.', type='text')
